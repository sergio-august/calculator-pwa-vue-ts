## Calculator App
Simple &amp; lightweight Calculator that you can try to use in the browser or install it on your device and use like usual application (thanks to PWA technology).

## Motivation
There are hundreds of calculators in the Google Play Store, some of them weight more than 10 Mb! I wrote this simple calculator to be as lightweight as possible and use as less as possible permissions on the phone.
